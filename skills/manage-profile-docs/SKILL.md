# Profile Documentation Management Skill

Manage profile-level documentation that defines standards, tech stack, and workflows for a specific profile (pjbeyer, work, play, home).

## Profile Documentation Components

### 1. Profile AGENTS.md
Core profile context for AI agents:
- Profile philosophy and purpose
- Tech stack and tools
- Quality standards (test coverage, documentation)
- Collaboration tools and processes
- Profile-specific workflows

**Token Budget**: 5-8k characters

### 2. Profile Standards
Documentation of profile-specific requirements:
- Code quality standards
- Testing requirements
- Documentation expectations
- Security practices
- Review processes

### 3. Tech Stack Documentation
Profile-specific technologies:
- Languages and frameworks
- Tools and services
- MCP servers configured
- Development environment
- Deployment processes

### 4. Collaboration Patterns
How teams work in this profile:
- Communication channels
- Review processes
- Decision-making
- Documentation platforms
- Meeting cadences

## Profile Differentiation

### pjbeyer Profile
- Professional/consulting work
- 80% test coverage minimum
- Comprehensive documentation
- Client-focused quality

### work Profile
- Enterprise/corporate
- 90% test coverage for critical paths
- Security-first approach
- Slim documentation (3-5k chars)
- Notion as primary platform

### play Profile

### Cross-Profile Coordination
1. Identify shared patterns
2. Extract to global docs where appropriate
3. Note profile-specific variations
4. Maintain clear boundaries
5. Avoid duplication
